</p>
<p>
A new ticket is created through the support portal after a customer submits an inquiry. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  
The system automatically assigns a unique ticket ID and sorts it into the right category based on the department and issue type. *(If a customer calls in or can't submit a ticket themselves, a support team member can create the ticket on their behalf.)*

</p>
<p>

</p>

<h4>Assignment and Communication</h4>

</p>
<p>
  
The ticket is assigned to the right agent based on its category and department. This assignment is done both manually and automatically using rules set up in the osTicket system.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<h4>Working the Issue</h4>

</p>
<p>
The assigned agent reviews the ticket, contacts the customer to gather more details, and starts troubleshooting the issue. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The agent offers initial solutions and then escalates the ticket to a higher support level for additional assistance.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<h4>Resolution</h4>

</p>
<p>
The issue is resolved after working with the customer, and the solution is confirmed. The agent marks the ticket as resolved, informs the customer about the fix, and waits for their confirmation.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Once the customer confirms that the issue is fixed, the ticket is officially closed.
<p>  
</p>
With the ticket lifecycle from intake through resolution now covered, the system is set to efficiently manage and resolve support requests within osTicket.
