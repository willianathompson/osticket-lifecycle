<h2>A new ticket was successfully created through the support portal after a customer submitted an inquiry. The system automatically assigned a unique ticket ID and sorted it into the right category based on the department and issue type. (If a customer calls in or can't submit a ticket themselves, a support team member can create the ticket on their behalf.)</h2>

</p>
<p>
  
The ticket was assigned to the right agent based on its category and department. This assignment was done both manually and automatically using rules set up in the osTicket system.

The assigned agent reviewed the ticket, contacted the customer to gather more details, and started troubleshooting the issue. The agent offered initial solutions and then escalated the ticket to a higher support level for additional assistance.

</p>
<p>
  
The issue was resolved after working with the customer, and the solution was confirmed. The agent marked the ticket as resolved, informed the customer about the fix, and waited for their confirmation.
  
</p>
<br />

Once the customer confirmed that the issue was fixed, the ticket was officially closed. A summary of the resolution was written, and the ticket was archived in the system for future reference and reporting.
